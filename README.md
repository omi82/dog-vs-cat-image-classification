# dog-vs-cat-image-classification

## Project Description
This project aims to classify images of dogs and cats using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of labeled dog and cat images and evaluated on a separate test set. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between dog and cat images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Dogs vs. Cats dataset. It consists of 25,000 images of dogs and cats (12,500 images each) for training and testing.

-  Training Set: 20,000 images (10,000 dogs and 10,000 cats)
-  Testing Set: 5,000 images (2,500 dogs and 2,500 cats

## Installation
To run this project, we need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
